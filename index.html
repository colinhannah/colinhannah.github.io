<h3>University of Georgia <abbr title="University of Georgia">UGA</abbr></h3>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;color:white;">I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and have lived in Georgia my entire life. 
I recently transferred to UGA from Georgia State University this past semester. 
Both of my parents have graduated from the University of Georgia, and I have been a Georgia Bulldogs fan since I was a young child.</p>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;color:white;">As a current student at the University of Georgia, I will be changing my major to Entertainment and Media Studies and my minor to Consumer Economics this Spring 2018. 
I feel this major is most pertinent to my career interests and onward career progression moving forward. 
I have always held a general interest in pursuing a career through creative endeavors, which has led to garnering strong interests in music, film, and storytelling. 
I want to further my studies in the contributions that arise from media and pursue a potential career within that field.</p>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;color:white">While spending time at the University of Georgia, I enjoy shopping for vinyl records, spending time with friends, and I have recently enjoyed playing racquetball at the Ramsey Student Center. 
I am a fan of the <b>Georgia Bulldogs Football Team</b> and look forward to my first experiences in the student section next semester.</p>
